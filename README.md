# Na-srebrnym-globie
My translation of the book Na Srebrnym Globie from Polish to English. Using CSS styling to show the translations of the text when needed.

The full book is available at: https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Na_srebrnym_globie.

## Motivation

I was looking for a useful way to view my translations in contect with the original text.

## Usage

Hover over each sentence and the English translation will appear in a text box (sometimes referred to as a tool-tip). The focal sentence will also change colour.
