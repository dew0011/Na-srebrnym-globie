# Na-srebrnym-globie
My translation of the book Na Srebrnym Globie from Polish to English. Uses CSS styling to show the translations of the text sentence by sentence.

The full book is freely available at: https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Na_srebrnym_globie.

To listen along an audio recording of the entire book (in the original Polish) can be found at LibriVox: https://librivox.org/na-srebrnym-globie-by-jerzy-zulawski/

## Motivation

I was looking for a useful way to view my translations in context with the original text. I hope that this may be a useful resource for others learning Polish. 

## Usage

Hover over (or for touchscreens, tap) on each sentence and the English translation will appear in a text box. The focal sentence will also change colour.

## Contributions

Any suggestions are most welcome, especially in regards to the translation of the text.
